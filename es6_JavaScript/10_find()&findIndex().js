/* Arrow Functions: find() and findIndex() 
  → Search for elements inside the Array
  
  → find(): used to search for an element in the array that matches some condition. It returns the first element that matches the condition.

  → findIndex(): quite similar to find, but returns the index of the first element instead of the element itself.
